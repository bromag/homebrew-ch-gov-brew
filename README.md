# homebrew-ch-gov-brew

What does this Project do?

You now have a secure wrapper that:
	•	Prevents unwanted taps
	•	Supports both formulae and casks
	•	Gives debug output
	•	Delegates everything else to the real brew

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

Purpose:

This wrapper enforces controlled package management for developers by:
	•	Blocking direct access to the original brew command
	•	Forcing all installations through the managed gov-brew wrapper
	•	Ensuring that only pre-approved formulae or casks from the internal Toolchain Team (hosted in a private GitHub tap) can be installed

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

Result:

Users interact with gov-brew as if it were a normal Homebrew, but under strict governance. This guarantees:
	•	A centrally managed toolchain
	•	Auditable software usage
	•	No external or unauthorized packages
